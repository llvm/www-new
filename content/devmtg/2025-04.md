    Tutorials are 50-60 minute sessions that dive down deep into a technical topic. Expect in depth examples and explanations.

- **Lightning Talks**

    These are fast 5 minute talks that give you a taste of a project or topic. Attendees will hear a wide range of topics and probably leave wanting to learn more.

- **Quick Talks**

    Quick 10 minute talks that dive a bit deeper into a topic, but not as deep as a Technical Talk.

- **Panels**

    Panels are 45-60 minute sessions that feature a panel of experts discussing a topic. Attendees will learn from the panelists and have a chance to ask questions.

What types of people attend?

- Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella (LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, flang, lld, MLIR, etc).
- Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.
- Students and Researchers
