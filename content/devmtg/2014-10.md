## About

The LLVM Foundation announces the eighth annual bay area LLVM Developers' Meeting will be held October 28th and 29th in San Jose, CA.

This year the conference will be 2 full days that include technical talks, BoFs, hackerâ€™s lab, tutorials, and a poster session. Attendance will be capped at 300.

The meeting serves as a forum for [LLVM](http://llvm.org/), [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/), [LLDB](http://lldb.llvm.org/), and other LLVM project developers and users to get acquainted, learn how LLVM is used, and exchange ideas about LLVM and its (potential) applications. More broadly, we believe the event will be of particular interest to the following people:

- Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella (LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, dragonegg, lld, etc).
- Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.
- Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.
- Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel and interesting ways.
