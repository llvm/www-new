## About

The 11th annual US LLVM Developers' Meeting was held October 18th and 19th in San Jose, California.

The conference included technical talks, BoFs, hacker's lab, tutorials, and posters.

The meeting serves as a forum for [LLVM](http://llvm.org/), [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/), [LLDB](http://lldb.llvm.org/), and other LLVM project developers and users to get acquainted, learn how LLVM is used, and exchange ideas about LLVM and its (potential) applications. More broadly, we believe the event will be of particular interest to the following people:

- Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella (LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, lld, etc).
- Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.
- Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.
- Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel and interesting ways.

Please sign up for the [LLVM Developers' Meeting list](http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/llvm-devmeeting) for future event announcements and to ask questions.
