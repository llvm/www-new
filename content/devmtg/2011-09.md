## About

**Sponsored by [ARM Ltd.](http://www.arm.com/)**

It was a half-day meeting for LLVM users to exchange ideas, expose new developments, and generally strengthen the network of LLVM developers in and around Europe. The meeting is open to anyone, from corporate to academia, and from professionals to enthusiasts.

While this was not a full conference like the US LLVM Developers' Meeting, we had talks, posters, demonstrations, and a lot of discussion.

There were almost 80 people, from academia and industry, experts, and newbies, and the feedback we received was excellent. The organizers of the Euro-LLVM 2011 would like to thank everyone for helping us make this successful event.

The topic themes for the September 2011 meeting included:

- CPU architecture support, code generation, generic optimizations
- OpenCL and graphics processing
- Interesting research and projects using the LLVM infrastructure
- Current developments and the future of LLVM (MC, JIT, vectorisation, &c.)
