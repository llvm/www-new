## About

**Sponsored by [Apple](http://apple.com/), [QuIC](http://www.qualcomm.com/quicinc/), [Google](http://google.com/), and [Qualcomm](http://qualcomm.com/)**

The meeting serves as a forum for [LLVM](http://llvm.org/), [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/), [LLDB](http://lldb.llvm.org/), and other LLVM project developers and users to get acquainted, learn how LLVM is used, and exchange ideas about LLVM and its (potential) applications. More broadly, we believe the event will be of particular interest to the following people:

- Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella (LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, dragonegg, etc).
- Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.
- Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.
- Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel and interesting ways.

We also invite you to sign up for the [official Developer Meeting mailing list](http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/llvm-devmeeting) to be kept informed of updates concerning the meeting.
