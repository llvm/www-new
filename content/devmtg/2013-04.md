## Announcement

The conference already took place. Here's the original announcement:
"We are pleased to announce the third European LLVM conference on April 29-30, 2013 in Paris, France. This will be a two-day conference which aims to present the latest developments in the LLVM world and help strengthen the network of LLVM developers. The format will be similar to that of the previous meetings held in London but with more time for presentations and networking. The meeting is open to anyone, whether from business or academia, professional or enthusiast, and is not restricted to those from Europe - attendees from all regions are welcome."
