## About

The LLVM Foundation announces the ninth annual bay area LLVM Developers' Meeting will be held October 29th and 30th in San Jose, CA.

This year the conference will be 2 full days that include technical talks, BoFs, hackerâ€™s lab, tutorials, and a poster session. Attendance will be capped at 350.

The meeting serves as a forum for [LLVM](http://llvm.org/), [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/), [LLDB](http://lldb.llvm.org/), and other LLVM project developers and users to get acquainted, learn how LLVM is used, and exchange ideas about LLVM and its potential applications. More broadly, we believe the event will be of particular interest to the following people:

- Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella (LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, dragonegg, lld, etc).
- Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.
- Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.
- Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel and interesting ways.

Please sign up for the [LLVM Developers' Meeting list](http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/llvm-devmeeting) for future announcements and to ask questions.

You may also contact the organizer, [Tanya Lattner](tanyalattner@llvm.org).
