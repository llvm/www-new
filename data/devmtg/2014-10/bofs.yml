    description: "Having at least some public performance tracking that the majority of the community cares about would make it easier to collaborate for all developers improving the quality of LLVM-generated code. During last year's BoF, we identified some key shortcomings in LNT to be able to produce low-noise performance numbers on the test-suite and most of them have been fixed recently."

    description: "There's been quite a bit of interest in a Debug Info BOF following the one we had last year at the 2013 Developer Conference. This BOF will cover everything from scaling our current handling of debug information, to ongoing work on debug information correctness, and future proposals for DWARF standardization."

    description: "Today's LLVM testing frameworks focus on testing native compilers on the same host where the test is compiled. The goal of this BoF is to examine the components necessary for change and to discuss potential solutions that allow for running tests on remote hosts in a way that best benefits the overall community."

    description: "The lld linker is a solid foundation for a general-purpose linker, as well as a set of libraries for creating linker-like tools. We will talk about the current status of lld, what the shortcomings are for a production linker, and what major areas need to be implemented, such as LTO support, diagnostics, extensibility."
