    speaker: "Vedant Kumar - UC Berkeley"
    slides_url: "https://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/Slides/Kumar-LoopDiagonalization.pdf"
    video_url: ""
    description: "The effects of some loops can be captured by matrices. This talk shows how to take advantage of this fact to optimize away entire loops."

  - title: "PBQP register allocation"
    speaker: "Arnaud de Grandmaison - ARM, Lang Hames - Apple"

    video_url: ""
    description: "The PBQP register allocator has been part of the LLVM source code for a long time. This talk will present a high level overview of the PBQP allocator principles, as well as its status and future work."

  - title: "PBQP register allocation in the wild"
    speaker: "Arnaud de Grandmaison - ARM, Lang Hames - Apple"
    slides_url: "https://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/Slides/PBQP-update-and-in-the-wild.pdf"

    description: "This talk will present how the PBQP is used with 2 real world processors and report some performance numbers."

  - title: "Link-Time Optimization on PlayStation(R)4"
    speaker: "Yunzhong Gao - Sony Computer Entertainment America"
    slides_url: "https://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/Slides/Gao-LTO-lightning-talk.pdf"
    video_url: ""
    description: "As a follow-up to last year's presentation, this is a talk on our experience implementing LTO on PlayStation(R)4's proprietary linker, including some of the challenges and results we see in the games."

  - title: "Software Visualizer (SWViz): A tool for visually exploring Linux kernel with Clang"
    speaker: "Harsh Vardhan Dwivedi - QuIC"
    slides_url: "https://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/Slides/Dwivedi-SWViz.pdf"
    video_url: ""
    description: "SWViz is a tool to explore the call graph of a program. It's chief advantage being able to leverage the linker and compiler (Clang) to generate accurate call-graphs. Through use of Swviz one can quickly gain an understanding of how a program is working. This leads to a massive cutdown in number of hours spent understanding the call-flow of any mature codebase."

  - title: "LLVM for Interactive Modeling and High Performance Simulation"
    speaker: "Peng Cheng - The MathWorks, Inc."
    slides_url: "https://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/Slides/Cheng-InteractiveModeling.pdf"
    video_url: ""
    description: "At MathWorks, LLVM has been used to create multi-thread JIT engines for interactive modeling and high performance simulation. This talk will present why and how LLVM is used to implement the JIT engines as well as some challenges."

  - title: "AddressSanitizer for Windows"
    speaker: "Timur Iskhodzhanov - Google"
    slides_url: "https://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/Slides/ASan for Windows.pdf"
