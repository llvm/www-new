- title: "Building an Efficient JIT"
  speaker: "Nate Begeman (Apple, Inc.)"
  slides_url: "https://llvm.org/devmtg/2008-08/Begeman_EfficientJIT.pdf"
  video_url: "https://youtu.be/ZPw6JYIQfMo"
  description: "LLVM provides many of the facilities that you need to assemble a JIT for various purposes. This talk walks you through construction of a simple JIT for C code (based on Clang) and talks about some of the important APIs for doing this. After getting it working, Nate describes the efficiency implications of various choices and describes how to dramatically improve the efficiency of the first implementation."

- title: "Adobe Image Foundation and Adobe PixelBender"
  speaker: "Chuck Rose III (Adobe Inc.)"
  slides_url: "https://llvm.org/devmtg/2008-08/Rose_AdobePixelBender.pdf"
  video_url: "https://youtu.be/bzhXXfUbJv8"
  description: "Adobe Image Foundation is a system for JIT compiling code written in the Adobe PixelBender language to run on the CPU and GPU. This talk describes how AIF and PixelBender work and how it uses LLVM to evaluate dependencies, reason about dirty regions of images, and do pixel processing when a GPU cannot handle a program."

- title: "Finding Bugs with the Clang Static Analyzer"
  speaker: "Ted Kremenek (Apple, Inc.)"
  slides_url: "https://llvm.org/devmtg/2008-08/Kremenek_StaticAnalyzer.pdf"
  video_url: "https://youtu.be/_HTcWKqRXXs"
  description: "The Clang Static Analyzer is a standalone tool that finds bugs in C and Objective-C programs. The analyzer is 100% open source and part of the Clang project. Although still early in development, the tool has been effective at finding thousands of bugs in real-world code. This talk presents a high-level overview of its goals, implementation, and status."

- title: "Building a JIT compiler for PHP in 2 days"
