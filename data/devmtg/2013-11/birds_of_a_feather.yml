  description: "We lack a good public infrastructure to efficiently track performance improvements/regressions. As a small step to improve on the current situation, I propose to organize a BoF to discuss mainly the following topics: (a) What advantages do we want the performance tracking and benchmarking infrastructure to give us? (b) What are the main technical and non-technical challenges we expect for setting up an infrastructure?"

  description: "TableGen is an essential component of the LLVM ecosystem, and the time has come to consider its evolution. The largest issues are the lack of formal specification, the mixing of logical concepts, and the unsuitability for automated generation. The aim of this BoF is to gather ideas toward an improved specification language that follows the generally accepted criteria for domain-specific languages: well-defined domain meta-models, formally defined semantics, simplicity, expressiveness, and lack of redundancy."

  description: "Discussions about loop optimizations, both generic ones as well as polyhedral loop optimizations as implemented in Polly. Topics include the pass order for high-level loop optimizations, scalar evolution, dependence analysis, high-level loop optimizations in core LLVM, the polyhedral infrastructure of Polly, as well as the isl polyhedral support library."
