      You're smart. People really like you. And yet, you can't shake the
      feeling that maybe you don't really deserve your success. Or that someone
      else can do what you do better...and what if your boss can see it too? You
      are not alone: it's called the Imposter Syndrome. Believe it or not, the
      most confident and successful people often fear that they are actually
      inadequate. The great Maya Angelou once said, "I have written 11 books, but
      each time I think, 'Uh-oh, they're going to find out now. I've run a game
      on everybody, and they're going to find me out.’" But it doesn't have to be
      that way. In this workshop, you'll learn to identify the voice of your
      Imposter Syndrome and develop with strategies for dealing with your inner
      critics.

      To grow your career, you know what you need to do: improve your public
      speaking skills. Public speaking provides the visibility and professional
      credibility that helps you score the next big opportunity. But even more
      important is the fact that it transforms the way you communicate.
      Improved confidence and the ability to convey messages clearly will impact
      your relationships with your managers, coworkers, customers, industry
      peers, and even potential new hires.
      In this presentation, Karen Catlin will cover the importance of speaking at
      conferences and events, along with strategies to get started. She'll share
      some favorite tips from the book she co-authored with Poornima
      Vijayashanker, "Present! A Techie's Guide to Public Speaking." And she'll
      tell some embarrassing stories that are just too good to keep to herself.

      Over the past year we have hosted panels and BoFs on women in compilers
      and tools. We now need to take many of the items discussed during the
      events and put them into action. We will discuss some key areas and
      potentially break into smaller groups to determine action plans and steps
      to move forward.
