    description: |
      Since March 2022, MLIR has a Presburger library, FPL, that provides native support
      for a full set of polyhedral analysis operators. This functionality has already been
      deployed in the loop fusion pass in the Affine dialect and has also been used to enable
      better dependence analysis in CIRCT. In this tutorial, we demonstrate several case studies
      showing how to use FPL’s Presburger arithmetic functionality in MLIR. Reasoning
      precisely about sets of integers enables accurate analytical cache models and brings
      powerful transformations to loop optimizers for ML and HPC, formal verification, and
      hardware design. Despite many efforts to use Presburger arithmetic in LLVM, their use has
      thus far been confined to optional extensions like Polly due to the need for external
      Presburger libraries (e.g., isl) that were not part of the core compiler toolchain. In the
      course of developing FPL we worked closely with the LLVM community to make FPL and
      Presburger arithmetic available in the MLIR upstream repositories. In this talk, we give a
      detailed walkthrough and demonstrate how they can be used. Our objective is to overcome
      the longstanding ‘vendor-lock-in’ and inflexibility of polyhedral toolchains by
      working with the LLVM community to provide targeted analyses that enhance the native
      components of the LLVM ecosystem.
