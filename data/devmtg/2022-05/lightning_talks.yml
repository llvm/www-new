      As part of registering for the 2021 LLVM dev meeting, participants were asked to answer a
      few questions about how the LLVM community could increase engagement and contributions.
      Out of the 450 people replying, the top 3 issues mentioned were "sometimes people aren't
      receiving detailed enough feedback on their proposals"; "people are worried to come across
      as an idiot when asking a question on the mailing list/on record"; "People cannot find
      where to start; where to find documentation; etc." These were discussed in the community.o
      workshop at the 2021 LLVM dev meeting, and a summary of that discussion was presented by
      Adelina Chalmers as a keynote session, see 2021 LLVM Dev Mtg "Deconstructing the Myth:
      Only real coders contribute to LLVM!? - Takeaways" One of the solutions suggested to help
      address those top identified barriers from the majority of participants is introducing the
      concept of "office hours". We have taken some small steps since then to make "office
      hours" a reality. In this lightning talk, I will talk about what issues "office hours" is
      aiming to address; how both newbies and experienced contributors can get a lot of value
      out of them; and where we are in implementing this concept and how you can help for them
      to be as effective as possible.


  - title: "llsoftsecbook: an open source book on low-level software security for compiler developers"

      Many compiler engineers work on security hardening features and many of them feel their
      work would benefit from a better understanding of attacks and hardening techniques.
      Therefore, we recently started an open source book titled "Low Level Software Security for
      Compiler developers" at https://github.com/llsoftsec/llsoftsecbook/. It aims to help
      compiler developers improve their knowledge about security hardening; ultimately leading
      to more innovation and better implementations of security features.

      F18/Flang was accepted as the Fortran frontend of LLVM in 2019. The project joined the
      monorepo in 2020. Development of a large chunk of code dealing with the lowering of the
      parse-tree to FIR (Fortran IR) continued in a fork of the llvm-project. In the last year,
      a significant effort went in to upstreaming this fork. Most of this code is upstreamed and
      all development has shifted to the llvm-project monorepo. Much development effort has also
      gone into adding a runtime and lowering for Fortran 95. In parallel, great progress has
      been achieved on adding a driver, support for OpenMP 1.1+ and OpenACC. In this talk, I
      will summarize the developmental activities for the last year, the current status and
      future work.
