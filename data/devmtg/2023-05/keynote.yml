      In this Talk, I will explain how the LLVM release process works. How fixes are
      created, staged, tested, and reviewed to be included in a release and how community
      members can get involved and help improve future releases of LLVM.

      In this talk we will describe "-fbounds-safety", a new language extension
      implemented in Clang that brings bounds safety to the C language. The language extension
      addresses multiple of the practical challenges that have made existing approaches to safer
      C dialects difficult to adopt. Our approach facilitates incremental adoption by preserving
      source compatibility with standard C and preserving ABI-compatibility with C binaries. It
      also minimizes adoption effort by reconciling wide pointers (a.k.a. "fat" pointers) with
      ABI-preserving bounds annotations. "-fbounds-safety" has been adopted on millions of lines
      of production C code and proven to work in an industrial setting.
