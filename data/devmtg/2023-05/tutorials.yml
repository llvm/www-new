  - title: "Developing BOLT pass"
    speaker: "Amir Ayupov, Meta"
    video_url: "https://youtu.be/kPKPkg5ugMg"
    slides_url: "https://llvm.org/devmtg/2023-05/slides/Tutorial-May10/02-Ayupov-BOLTPass.pdf"
    description: |
      The tutorial covering the basics of BOLT pass development and debugging techniques, with
      examples of adding a simple peephole rule and a standalone pass. Debugging examples cover
      narrowing down a misoptimized function, producing an assembly test and visualizing the
      CFG.

  - title: "A whirlwind tour of the LLVM optimizer"
    speaker: "Nikita Popov, Red Hat"
    video_url: "https://youtu.be/7GHXDEIMGIY"
    slides_url: "https://llvm.org/devmtg/2023-05/slides/Tutorial-May10/01-Popov-AWhirlwindTour-oftheLLVMOptimizer.pdf"
    description: |
      This is a tour of LLVM's optimization pipeline: It provides an overview of all
      important optimization passes and analyses, as well as how they work together and fit into
      the overall optimization pipeline.

  - title: "Tutorial: Controllable Transformations in MLIR"
    speaker: "Alex Zinenko, Google"
    video_url: "https://youtu.be/P4gUj3QtH_Y"
    slides_url: "https://llvm.org/devmtg/2023-05/slides/Tutorial-May11/02-Zinenko-TransformDialectTutorial.pdf"
    description: |
      MLIR has recently introduced support for declaratively specifying and controlling compiler
      transformations via the transform dialect. It allows one to request compiler
      transformations using compiler IR itself, which can be embedded into the original IR that
      is being transformed (similarly to pragmas) or supplied separately (similarly to
      scheduling languages). This tutorial presents the concepts of the MLIR transform dialect
      and related infrastructure. It will be accompanied by a practical demonstration of three
      use scenarios: Composing transform dialect operations available in (upstream) MLIR
      to perform a sequence of optimizing transformations that results in efficient code for an
      MLIR linear algebra operation, defining new transform dialect operations and adapting
      existing transformation code to work with the transform dialect infrastructure, and
      setting up and using the transform dialect infrastructure in a downstream out-of-tree
      project with custom dialects, transformations and passes. After following the tutorial,
      the attendees will be able to apply the transform dialect in their work and extend
      it when necessary. Basic familiarity with MLIR is a prerequisite.

  - title: "GlobalISel by example"
    speaker: "Alex Bradbury, Igalia"
    video_url: "https://youtu.be/PEP0DfAT_N8"
    slides_url: "https://llvm.org/devmtg/2023-05/slides/Tutorial-May11/01-Bradbury-GlobalISelTutorial.pdf"
    description: |
      The GlobalISel framework was introduced with the intention of replacing
      SelectionDAG, aiming to provide advantages in terms of performance, granularity, and
      modularity. This tutorial will provide everything you need to know about using this
      framework for a new target, focusing on RISC-V as an example and working through some
      specific examples of challenging cases.
